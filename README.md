# 🛡️ AEGISSHIELD — QR Spoofing and Detection

> **Don't trust a QR code just because it looks legitimate. Verify what's behind it first.**

AEGISSHIELD is a **machine-learning-powered cybersecurity web application** designed to analyze URLs and QR-code payloads for potentially suspicious, phishing, or spoofed destinations.

The application allows users to **enter a URL manually or scan a QR code**, extract its underlying content, analyze the destination using a trained machine-learning model, and receive a clear **Safe / Unsafe security verdict with a risk level**.

---

## ✨ Overview

QR codes are convenient, but they can also hide malicious destinations.

An attacker can replace a legitimate QR code with a malicious one that redirects users to a phishing page, fake login portal, suspicious payment destination, or spoofed website.

AEGISSHIELD acts as a security checkpoint between **scanning a QR code and trusting its destination**.

# 🚀 Key Features

### 🔗 URL Detection

Enter a URL manually and analyze it for suspicious characteristics associated with phishing and malicious websites.

### 📷 QR Code Scanning

Scan QR codes directly using the device camera.

The application automatically:

1. Detects the QR code.
2. Extracts its payload.
3. Determines the content type.
4. Analyzes URLs when applicable.
5. Displays the security verdict.

### 🤖 Machine Learning Detection

AEGISSHIELD uses a trained **Gradient Boosting Classifier** for URL classification.

The model analyzes multiple URL security characteristics rather than relying on a single rule.

### 🧩 URL Feature Analysis

The feature-extraction pipeline evaluates characteristics such as:

* IP address usage
* URL length
* URL shortening
* Suspicious symbols
* Redirect patterns
* Domain structure
* Subdomains
* HTTPS usage
* Domain registration information
* Non-standard ports
* External resource behavior
* Anchor URL behavior
* Other URL and webpage characteristics

### 🟢 Safe Detection

For URLs classified as safe, the application provides a clear green security state:

> **Website is 100% safe to use.**

along with:

> **Risk Level — LOW**

### 🔴 Unsafe Detection

For suspicious URLs, AEGISSHIELD displays a prominent warning state:

> **Website is 100% unsafe to use.**

along with:

> **Risk Level — HIGH**

The interface also warns users that the link may contain phishing or QR-spoofing attempts.

### 💳 UPI & Non-Web QR Handling

Not every QR code contains a website.

AEGISSHIELD can recognize QR payloads such as:

```text
upi://pay?pa=example@upi
```

and distinguish them from normal website URLs.

Plain-text QR content can also be handled separately rather than being incorrectly passed through the URL phishing classifier.

### 📋 Payload Inspection

The extracted QR content is displayed clearly in the analysis panel so users can see what is actually encoded inside the QR code.

A copy button is also provided for convenient payload inspection.

### 🔐 Privacy-Focused Design

The interface communicates a privacy-first approach:

> **We never store your data. All scans are private and secure.**

### 🎨 Cybersecurity SaaS Interface

AEGISSHIELD uses a modern security-console design featuring:

* Dark navy interface
* Cyan/blue security accents
* Green safe state
* Red unsafe state
* Glass-style cards
* Responsive layout
* Professional icons
* Clear risk indicators
* Security-focused visual hierarchy

# 🔍 URL Feature Extraction

The application extracts a set of security-related features from URLs before sending them to the machine-learning model.

Examples include:

| Feature              | Purpose                                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| IP Address           | Detects URLs using raw IP addresses          |
| URL Length           | Identifies unusually long URLs               |
| URL Shortening       | Detects shortened URLs                       |
| `@` Symbol           | Identifies suspicious URL structures         |
| Redirecting          | Detects potential redirects                  |
| Domain Prefix/Suffix | Examines suspicious domain patterns          |
| Subdomains           | Measures domain complexity                   |
| HTTPS                | Checks secure protocol usage                 |
| Domain Registration  | Examines domain registration characteristics |
| Non-standard Port    | Detects unusual ports                        |
| Favicon              | Checks favicon-related behavior              |
| Request URL          | Analyzes external resource requests          |
| Anchor URL           | Examines anchor/link behavior                |

The feature vector used during prediction is kept consistent with the model's training pipeline.

# ⚙️ Installation

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_URL>
cd AEGISSHIELD
```

## 2. Create a Virtual Environment

### Windows

```powershell
python -m venv venv
```

Activate it:

```powershell
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### macOS / Linux

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

## 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

# ▶️ Run the Application

From the project workspace directory:

```powershell
venv\Scripts\python app.py
```

Once Flask starts, open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8001
```

The exact address and port may also be displayed in the terminal when the application starts.

---

# 📷 Using the QR Scanner

1. Open the AEGISSHIELD dashboard.
2. Click **Start QR Scan**.
3. Allow camera access.
4. Point the camera at a QR code.
5. Wait for the QR payload to be detected.
6. AEGISSHIELD analyzes the extracted content.
7. Review the security verdict and risk level.

For browser camera access on a deployed application, HTTPS may be required.

---

# 🧪 Testing

AEGISSHIELD can be tested using different QR and URL categories.

### Safe Test

```text
https://example.com
```

Expected:

```text
🟢 SAFE
Risk Level — LOW
```

### Suspicious Test

Use a simulated suspicious URL such as:

```text
http://secure-login-paypal.example.test/verify-account
```

Expected:

```text
🔴 UNSAFE
Risk Level — HIGH
```

The `.test` domain is intended for testing and is not a real malicious website.

### UPI Test

```text
upi://pay?pa=test@example
```

This should be handled as a payment/UPI payload rather than as a normal website URL.

### Plain Text QR

```text
Hello from AEGISSHIELD
```

This should be treated as non-URL content.

---

# 📊 Model Evaluation

The original machine-learning experimentation compared multiple classification algorithms before selecting the best-performing approach.

The **Gradient Boosting Classifier** was selected for the URL detection component.

For reproducibility, evaluate the final retrained model using:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-score
* Confusion Matrix

### Important

Model performance metrics should always be reported on a **held-out test set**.

Do not interpret test-set accuracy as a guarantee of real-world phishing detection performance.

For the latest evaluation results, refer to the project's training notebook and `walkthrough.md`.

---

# 🔒 Security Considerations

AEGISSHIELD is designed as an additional security layer.

A **SAFE** classification does not guarantee that a website is completely harmless.

Likewise, an **UNSAFE** classification should be treated as a strong warning.

Users should never enter sensitive information such as:

* Passwords
* OTPs
* UPI PINs
* Banking credentials
* Credit/debit card information
* Authentication tokens

into websites they do not trust.

---

# ⚠️ Limitations

The detection system has several practical limitations:

* Machine-learning predictions depend on the training data.
* New phishing techniques may not match previously learned patterns.
* Some domain information may be unavailable.
* Network-dependent feature extraction may fail when a website blocks automated requests.
* A QR code containing a legitimate URL can still lead to harmful content if the website becomes compromised later.
* Detection results should therefore be treated as **security guidance rather than an absolute guarantee**.

---

# 🎯 Project Objective

The primary objective of AEGISSHIELD is to make QR-based interactions more transparent and safer by allowing users to **inspect the destination behind a QR code before interacting with it**.

Instead of:

```text
SCAN → TRUST
```

AEGISSHIELD encourages:

```text
SCAN → INSPECT → ANALYZE → VERIFY → PROCEED
```

---

# 💡 Why AEGISSHIELD?

QR codes hide their actual payload from users.

AEGISSHIELD exposes that payload and applies an additional layer of machine-learning-based security analysis.

> **See what's behind the QR before you trust it.**
